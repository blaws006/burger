## Description 
Come for the burgers, stay for the App.
This Burger App let's a user create a burger and devour that burger and the additional burgers on the screen.

MySQL handles the storing of data (burger_name, id, devoured). Handlerbars, is the templating engine that brings each burger and their devoured status onto the client side from the server side. API Routing allows for reading, creation and status update of each burger to be translated from the front end to the back end.

## Installation

* Clone repo on your hard drive using `git@github.com:blaws006/burger.git`
* Use `npm install` for all of the modules you need
* Run the sql files in your MySQL client
* Fire up your server using `npm start`
