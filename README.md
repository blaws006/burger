Come for the burgers, stay for the App.

This Burger App let's a user create a burger and devour that burger and the additional burgers on the screen. 

MySQL handles the storing of data (burger_name, id, devoured).
Handlerbars, is the templating engine that brings each burger and their devoured status onto the client side from the server side.
API Routing allows for reading, creation and status update of each burger to be transalted from the front end to the back end.
